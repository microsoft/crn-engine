          Each discovered transition results in a work item on the work list
          A work item has three components:
           - source state of the transition
           - reaction making the transition, with propensity
           - list of other reactions applicaple to the source state (all these will be known and passed on to the target state)
          Handling a work item means:
           - compute the target state
           - add transition to graph (with memoization)
           - compute list of reactions applicaple to target state
             These are the ones applicaple to the source state plus the ones arising from new species
           - add work items for each reaction applicaple to target state
