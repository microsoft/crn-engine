//Adapts costom PRNG (LCG for now) to System.Random like interface
//So you can use Rng.Random instead of System.Random across other components

// FP: due to concerns about performance and reproducibility when used with the new SSA trajectories feature, the RNG is no longer thread-safe. A separate RNG instance should be used for each thread.
