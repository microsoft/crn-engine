// FP: there is a problem with Monaco where if you type a row and hit enter really, really fast, the enter may get caught by an autocompletion widget that appeared at some point while you were typing, and should have been discarded by the time you got to the end of the row, but in reality was still around. When this happens, the autocompletion will trigger and cause an extra token to get inserted at the point where autocompletion was started. This can be avoided by having a small pause before hitting enter, enough to let Monaco dispose the autocompletion widget. Also, note that I'm adding an extra space at the end of each line; this way, I'll get rid of any autocomplete box that was opened by the last token.
