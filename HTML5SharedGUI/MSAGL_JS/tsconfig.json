    // It once happened that the node_modules/@types folder got the nodejs types in it for some reason. This caused several browser functions to have their types redefined, causing compilations to fail in a way that's fairly hard to diagnose. This line causes the TS compiler to only use typings that are explicitly listed here. This adds a slight maintenance burden, but I currently do not see any better solution.
